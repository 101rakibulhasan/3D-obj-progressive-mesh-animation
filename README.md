Overview:
This project demonstrates a progressive 3D mesh viewer built using OpenGL and C++. The core idea is to procedurally visualize the construction of 3D models starting from vertices, then connecting edges, and finally forming faces. The animation progresses step by step, simulating how a model is built in real time through loops and condition-based logic.

By loading .OBJ files, the system parses the vertex, edge, and face data and incrementally displays them on screen, helping users understand mesh structure development. This type of visualization is particularly useful for educational purposes, debugging 3D model data, and exploring mesh simplification or progressive rendering techniques.

The purpose of this project is to explore and demonstrate real-time procedural animation by manipulating mesh elements (vertices, edges, and faces) directly on the GPU using vertex shaders. This project showcases how mathematical functions—such as trigonometric waveforms—can be applied to mesh geometry to create dynamic, organic motion without relying on traditional keyframe animation. It serves both as a technical demonstration of shader-based animation and as an educational tool for understanding GPU-accelerated graphics programming and real-time rendering techniques.

The following models has been used for testing the programs capability, not for redistribution. This program will support any 3D Obj format so we could delete and use other for testing if we face issue.
